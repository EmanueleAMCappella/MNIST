# MNIST
This repository holds the models and data analyses I used to tackle the classic MNIST challenge. More specifically, you can find:
* a convolutional neural network in Keras, which I run with the help of Google Colab (and its free GPU);
* the hyperparameters tuning of a random forest classifier
* a more complete end-to-end exploratory project that follows the MNIST chapter in the infamous book Hands-on Machine Learning of Aurelien Geron
